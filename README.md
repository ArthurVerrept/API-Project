# API-Project

--- DUE TO API CHANGES THIS IS NO LONGER WORKING ---

This was the second javascript project I made, the idea was to use an API to display information. This project opened my ideas as to what was possible with web design.

The API had the top 400 richest billionaires, and information like country of origin, source of wealth, company, shares and age. I then used that information to display images of them, their home country flag, and then did calculations to find out if you combined the wealth of a certain amount of them (defined by the user), how does it compage to an entire countries GDP. The aim being to show the greed that the 0.1% really display.

The user could choose how many billionaires are on screen, what countries GDP to compare etc.
